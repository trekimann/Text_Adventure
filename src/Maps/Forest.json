  "mapDescription":"The Enchanted Forest is a mystical and mysterious place, teeming with all manner of strange and dangerous creatures. The forest is split into four main areas, each with its own unique characteristics and dangers. The first area is the Orc Fortress, a sturdy and imposing structure made of crude stone and iron, home to the fierce and brutish orcs. The second area is the Spooky Cave, a dark and foreboding cavern filled with twisted tunnels and eerie echoes. The third area is the player's home, a humble abode nestled deep in the heart of the forest, where the player can rest and recover from their adventures. The final area is the Wizard's Armoury, a hidden and magical armory filled with powerful weapons and ancient artifacts, protected by a powerful magic key. Each of these areas presents its own unique challenges, as well as its own opportunities for treasure and glory. The player must navigate the perils of the Enchanted Forest, using their wits and skill to defeat the fierce creatures that lurk in its shadows, in order to uncover the secrets of the Wizard's Armoury.",
