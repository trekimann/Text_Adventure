# Text Adventure game

Just a little project to play with [GPT3][1] and practice some python.
The idea is to make a text adventure engine of sorts that is driven by a [JSON file][2].
I hope to eventually hook up [GPT3][1] directly though an API so that when a player moves to a new grid then GPT3 can generate the grid's details on the fly allowing for unlimited map size.
