# Text Adventure game

Just a little project to play with GPT3 and practice some python.
The idea is to make a text adventure engine of sorts that is driven by a JSON file.
I hope to eventually hook up GPT3 directly though an API so that when a player moves to a new grid then GPT3 can generate the grid's details on the fly allowing for unlimited map size.
